# dev_image_viewer

dev_image_viewer is a simple image viewer for Windows, designed to show the pixels of images exactly as they are, and auto-reload changes.

Features:
* magnifies in exact integer scales (2X, 4X, ...), with nearest neighbor filtering
* minifies in inverse integer scales, with box filtering
* automatically reloads when the file is modified
* small, single-file executable, with very fast startup
* no extra junk in the UI you never use (e.g. slideshows, editing, printing, burning, emailing)
